Steps:
    - (optional) separate into Y, Cb, Cr matrices
    - for each 8x8 block:
        - DCT
        - quantisation
        - RLE
        - huffman on RLE
    - NOTE: at this point, each 8x8 block has been converted to array of bytes
            of indeterminate length
    - concatenate the blocks, separating each by an EOB char
