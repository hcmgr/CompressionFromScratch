TODO
    - get demo working
    - README steps
    - make a #DEBUG macro
    - clean up variable names and structure
    - make jpeg.hpp and give it a nice interface
    - remove experiments.hpp/cpp

Steps:
    - (optional) separate into Y, Cb, Cr matrices
    - for each 8x8 block:
        - DCT                   => 8x8 block
        - quantisation          => 8x8 block
        - zig-zag               => 64-d vector
        - RLE                   => l-d vector, l <= 64
        - huffman on RLE        => m-d vector, m <= l

    - NOTE: at this point, each 8x8 block has been converted to array of bytes
            of indeterminate length
    - concatenate the blocks, separating each by an EOB char

TODO:
    - re-construct from huffman-enocded block,
      not just image itself
