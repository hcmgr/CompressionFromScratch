Steps:
    - (optional) separate into Y, Cb, Cr matrices
    - for each 8x8 block:
        - DCT                   => 8x8 block
        - quantisation          => 8x8 block
        - zig-zag               => 64-d vector
        - RLE                   => l-d vector, l <= 64
        - huffman on RLE        => m-d vector, m <= l

    - NOTE: at this point, each 8x8 block has been converted to array of bytes
            of indeterminate length
    - concatenate the blocks, separating each by an EOB char

TODO:
    - each .cpp gives an object file
    - see what compression we get
